  <h1>Molding and Casting</h1> 
  <div id="desc">
    <p>I forgot to take a picture of this project. But I was able to get experience with parafen wax and plaster molding.</p>
    <p>For my plater mold I tried to make a simple bunny face design out of plaster.</p>
    <p>I think it would have worked out better if I had 3D printed an object to make an indentation into the sand, instead of trying to pack the sand down by hand.</p> 
    <p>I also messed around with trying to get food coloring designs in a wax mold. It was tricky though because the dye would cool the wax down and harden it.</p>
