    <h4>Origami Lunchbox</h4>
  <div id="desc">
    <p>The idea behind this is that it's a lunch box that can keep your food from getting squished, but it can also fold down flat in your backpack after you use it. The cylinders sticking out are supposed to be snaps, and the rectangles sticking out the top are supposed to represent those flaps on the lid that seal your food.</p>
